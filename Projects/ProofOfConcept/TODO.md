- Increase GroundBubbleSynth max volume when very close.
    - It sounds like items behind the camera are in front, and vice-versa, which may mean there's a bug in the spatial-
      audio azimuth calculated from the camera direction.

- Add thank you notes.

- Update README.md.

- Fix Csound comment stripper so it doesn't strip urls like https://github.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio-web-sdk.
