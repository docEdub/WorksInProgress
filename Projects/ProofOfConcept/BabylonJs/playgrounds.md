        - Just tested on my Android. Glitched a little bit at the start, but after that it ran fine. I'll test on some other devices later.
        - It's an older Samsung S8. It was Chrome 91.0.4472.101
        - Just have a quick run on my Quest 1 and Hololens 2. Both couldn't keep up and kept stuttering.
